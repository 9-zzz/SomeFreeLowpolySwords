# 1000FreeLowpolySwords
![demo](1000.gif)
I will be adding sword models to this repository every day until I hit 1,000!
They will all be released under the Creative Commons license.
This is to celebrate hitting 1,000 Twitter followers today.
It is also to force myself to create things every day and follow through on projects!
The sword models are all created in Blender with out textures, only materials and colors.
